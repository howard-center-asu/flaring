# Gaslit

Oil and gas operators in the United States are required to disclose the volume of natural gas they routinely burn off or release into the atmosphere during processes respectively known as flaring and venting. In [Gaslit](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/howardcenter/gaslit), the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism compared these reported volumes against those recorded by satellites. 

This repository contains notebooks detailing the Howard Center's analysis of the satellite data and operator-reported volumes from 2012 to 2020.

### Satellite data 

Satellite data is [available](https://eogdata.mines.edu/download_global_flare.html) from the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines, along with a detailed [explanation](http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/1/14) by Christopher Elvidge of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) technology used the measure flaring. 

Using latitude-longitude coordinates and shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Howard Center plotted satellite-recorded flares to corresponding U.S. states and jurisdiction (state, federal, or tribal). A copy of that data set is available from the Howard Center [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-FBaY79bGB_ITt-73K4kIUnMHhN-pDS/view?usp=sharing)

### State data

Of the United States’ 32 oil and gas producing states, the Howard Center focused on the 13 [labeled](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HUgQ1Bj6H8fejftY4m8IXANWdlNK5Jj/view?usp=sharing) by the U.S. Department of Energy as either Category I (“States With Significant Ongoing and Increasing Flaring Activity”) or Category II (“States Where Limited Flaring Occurs and Likelihood of Increase is Limited”). 

Data availability and reporting requirements, which varied from state-to-state, are detailed in the corresponding state notebooks. 

Data wasn’t publicly available in an accessible format from four states: Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. 

Reporters for the Howard Center built a database, available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xqz5JLrsUa5OJH55MG5JG_btC02T6lCM/view?usp=sharing) to total approved flaring and venting volumes in Oklahoma by extracting data from more than 800 flaring and venting requests submitted to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission between 2012 and 2020.  

Reporters contacted relevant agencies in the remaining nine states to gather operator-reported data. The data, typically available on an annual basis, needed to be compiled and cleaned before reporters could calculate how much natural gas operators flared or vented in a given year. (For more information about our data cleaning, please contact: howardcenter@asu.edu). 
 

Data for each state is typically current as of November 2021, meaning it may not reflect revisions or amendments made after it was downloaded.
