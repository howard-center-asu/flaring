# Gaslit

This repository contains the Howard Center's data analysis for [Gaslit](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/howardcenter/gaslit), its 2022 investigation of flaring and venting by oil and gas industry in the United States.

Oil and gas operators release large volumes of methane and carbon dioxide, two of the most potent greenhouse gases, by burning natural gas or releasing it directly into the atmosphere. They are required to report those volumes to state agencies tasked with regulating waste by the oil and gas industry. 

Howard Center reporters compared operator-reported volumes to satellite recorded data [available](https://eogdata.mines.edu/download_global_flare.html) from the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines. 

Using latitude-longitude coordinates the Howard Center plotted satellite-recorded flares to their corresponding U.S. state and jurisdiction (state, federal, or tribal). A copy of that data is available from the Howard Center [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-FBaY79bGB_ITt-73K4kIUnMHhN-pDS/view?usp=sharing)

Of the United States’ 32 oil and gas producing states, the Howard Center focused its investigation on the 13 [labeled](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HUgQ1Bj6H8fejftY4m8IXANWdlNK5Jj/view?usp=sharing) by the U.S. Department of Energy as either Category I (“States With Significant Ongoing and Increasing Flaring Activity”) or Category II (“States Where Limited Flaring Occurs and Likelihood of Increase is Limited”). 

Operator-reported data was not readily available from four states: Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. 

Reporters for the Howard Center built a database, available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xqz5JLrsUa5OJH55MG5JG_btC02T6lCM/view?usp=sharing) to total approved flaring and venting volumes in Oklahoma by extracting data from more than 800 flaring and venting requests submitted to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission between 2012 and 2020.  

Reporters contacted relevant agencies in each of the nine remaining states to gather operator-reported data. The data, typically available on an annual basis, needed to be compiled and cleaned before reporters could calculate how much natural gas operators flared or vented in a given year. (For more information about our data process, please contact: howardcenter@asu.edu). 

Data for each state is typically current as of November 2021, meaning it may not reflect revisions or amendments made after it was downloaded.
