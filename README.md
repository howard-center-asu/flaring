# Gaslit

U.S. oil and gas operators are required to disclose how much natural gas they routinely burn off or simply release into the atmosphere, practices respectively known in as flaring and venting. In Gaslit, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism checked reported volumes in 13 top oil and gas producing states against those recorded by a satellite equipped with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments. 

This repository contains notebooks detailing Howard Center reporters' analyses of the satellite data and volumes reported to state agencies.
