To the Flaring team: We'll change this readme later on, but for now : Put anything you want to render on a web page (any html files) here. Feel free to add subfolders. 

Note that we will have to make the entire repo public when we want to publish your knitted notebooks, so don't put anything in this that you don't want eventually made public.
